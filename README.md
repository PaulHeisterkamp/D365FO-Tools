# D365FO-Tools
This repository contains tools for Microsoft Dynamics 365 For Operations (formally known as AX).
It is a collection of tool's, which I often use in implementation projects. 
All tools are included in the package/model D365FO-Tool and you can find a separate project for each tool in the project folder. 

# Get started 
On a developer VM map the folder XYZ to your metadata folder (e. g. C:/AosService/PackageLocalDirectory) and map the Projects folder to your projects folder. 

# Warrenty
The code comes without any warranty.
